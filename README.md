# NFT-Based Digital Identity Cards

## Project Title
NFT-Based Digital Identity Cards

## Project Description
This project implements a blockchain-based digital identity management system where each user can mint a unique, non-fungible identity card as an NFT. These digital identity NFTs are secured, verifiable, and easily transferable, advancing identity management beyond paper-based or centralized digital systems.

## Project Vision
The vision is to empower individuals worldwide with self-sovereign, tamper-proof, and easily verifiable digital identities, reducing fraud and streamlining access to online and offline services.

## Key Features
- Each user can mint a unique digital identity NFT linked to their address.
- Token metadata can contain encrypted or open identity data (e.g., name, affiliation, credentials).
- Users and admins can revoke (burn) identity NFTs for security or lifecycle management.
- Anyone can verify if a given address holds a valid identity NFT.
- One-identity-per-user enforcement ensures authenticity and prevents sybil attacks.

## Future Scope
- Integration with soulbound tokens for non-transferable identities.
- Biometric verification linked via off-chain oracles.
- Compatibility with government or institutional identity standards.
- Privacy enhancements (e.g., zero-knowledge proofs for selective attribute sharing).
- Decentralized recovery mechanisms for lost or stolen identity NFTs.
